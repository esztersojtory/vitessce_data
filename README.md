# In a Glimpse

This page aims to simplify the process of transforming a Seurat object to a Vitessce visualisation. 

Starting File: Processed and Analysed Seurat Object

**Steps:**
1. Transform to Zarr store
2. Data hosting (on GitHub Pages or locally)
3. Create a config in the Vitessce App + customise as needed
4. Uploading config.JSON to GitHub to create a unique URL

Final Product: Interactive Vitessce Visualisation accessible on the web (if data is hosted publicaly)

# Transform Seurat object to zarr store in R

The following instructions detail process of creating a custom Vitessce visualisation from a Seurat object.

## Installation

Installation requires R 4.0.0 or greater.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vitessce/vitessceR")
devtools::install_github("vitessce/vitessceAnalysisR")

```

## Usage

Load required packages:

```r
library(Seurat)
library(Matrix)
library(vitessceR)
library(vitessceAnalysisR)
```

Transform to zarr store (.h5ad.zarr) (making sure that the adatapath directory exists prior to running):

```r
adata_path <- file.path("data", "example", "example.h5ad.zarr")
vitessceAnalysisR::seurat_to_anndata_zarr(so, adatapath)
```

# Data Hosting

## Static Web Servers

### GitHub Pages

1. Create the GitHub repository where the data will be hosted.
2. Clone the export folder (.h5ad.zarr) to the previously created repository.
3. Add a blank ```.nojekyll``` file to the root of the repository.
4. Set up GitHub Pages, from the Settings tab, from the  branch of the repository where the data was uploaded to.

### Other Alternatives

The data can also be hosted on other static web servers such as AWS S3 buckets or Google Cloud, which could be necesary for particularly large files. However, these are paid services at such file size and in most cases GitHub Pages should work. The specific bucket policies for AWS and Google Cloud can be found on the [Vitessce Website](http://vitessce.io/docs/data-hosting/).

## Local Files

Local hosting allows for the visualisation of not yet published data.
To serve data locally, any web server that can serve a directory should work, but Vitessce recommend http-server:

```
brew install http-server
```
```
npm install --global http-server
```

Then, navigate to the data directory and run the server:

```
http-server ./ --cors -p 9000
```

# Create Vitessce config

The config.json can be created from scratch, or by editing a previous template/example. This Vitessce configuration will specify:

- The dataset
- The visualisation types (widgets)
- Linking of visualisation parameters across views
- Other design choices (colours, layout etc)

The Vitessce App provides basic configs. These can be accessed by entering the URL to the zarr the star store in the provided textbox in the Vitessce App. If the URL points to the correct filetype, 6 options will appear to select a view layout for the provided URL. Select one and Load from the Editor. This resulting visualisation can then be customised with the required metadata and additional widgets in the Editor.

For customisation, I highly recommend copying from examples. The configs that I have created can be found in this repository in the .h5ad.zarr directories. More example configs are available on the [Vitessce Website](http://vitessce.io/examples/), by selecting an example and clicking "Edit" in the top right corner.


## Upload JSON

If the data is hosted on GitHub, upload the JSON as well. Ensure that the URL in the config.JSON points to the .h5ad.zarr directory in the GitHub Page ([user.github.io/example/example.h5ad.zarr](http://user.github.io/example/example.h5ad.zarr)).

# Vitessce URL

A shareable [Vitessce.io](http://vitessce.io/) URL can now be generated by following this template.

- http://vitessce.io/#?url=https://example.github.io/example/example.h5ad.zarr/config.json
